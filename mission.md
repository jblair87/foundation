# Our Mission

In 2016, the United Nations produced a list of <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> to help address the world's most pressing problems. Fourth on their list was quality education, with the hope that "all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy." Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FINAL-Millions-Learning-Report-1.pdf"> 38% of children worldwide</a> have not achieved literacy and numeracy. In fact:

<h2 class="quote">"250 million children around the globe lack the most basic literacy and numeracy skills."</h2>

To make matters worse, there is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FINAL-Millions-Learning-Report-1.pdf">a 100 year gap</a> between educational outcomes in developed and developing countries, meaning that "it could take more than 100 years for students in developing countries just to reach <em>today's</em> average level in developed regions when it comes to scienceâ€”and they might never close the gap in math" (emphasis added).

<h2 class="quote">The Oppia Foundation exists to help close that gap.</h2>

Oppia's mission is to help anyone, anywhere learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way.

To achieve that, we have created a free, open-source learning platform with a focus on locally-contextual, demonstrably effective educational experiences.

Oppia's lessons build on established pedagogy research, simulating an interactive tutor that engages the user in active learning and both identifies and addresses common misconceptions they may have. These adaptive lessons are created and refined by a diverse community of international contributors, seeding Oppia's software with enough information to provide specific and targeted feedback to help learners improve.

So far, educators have created over 10,000 of these lessons. And they've served over 500,000 users.

500,000 might not be 250 million &mdash; but it's a start.

And, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/">with your help</a>, we might just get there.
