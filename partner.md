<h1>Let's Make a Difference Together</h1>
<h2>Here's how you can help Oppia reach even more learners.</h2>
<p>Improving education for all is a large effort. Any help you provide could impact potentially millions of learners. It doesn't matter where you come from, what language you speak, or how old or young you are — this is a community project! As long as you're willing to help, we'd love to have you join the cause.</p>

      <p>Oppia needs money to help serve more students with more lessons. Any money you provide will go directly towards improving content (e.g. hiring teachers to review and improve lessons) or improving the student experience (e.g. paying for hosting the oppia.org site). For every A dollar, Oppia can launch X explorations that work on Y low-bandwidth devices, ultimately helping Z students improve their math literacy.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create or improve lessons: Create lessons on Oppia, so that students can learn a wider range of topics. Alternatively, consider reviewing Oppia explorations and providing feedback on them, so that students get more out of each lesson.
        Try out lessons and give feedback: We also really encourage you to participate in our user studies -- they’re fun and can help us improve the learning experience for our students!</li>
        <li>Build features: In addition to helping us better Oppia’s lessons, you can also contribute to our open source code, product design, and more. Check out our GitHub wiki here.</li>
        <li>Materials: If you have created high-quality educational materials (videos, images, text), and are willing to have them used in Oppia lessons, please let us know.</li>

You can help us spread Oppia by putting the Oppia badge on your site, pointing students/teachers at lessons on Oppia, and connecting Oppia with potential industry partners!</li>
        <li>Use Oppia with your students: If you’re an educator, we’d also love for you to integrate Oppia lessons into your existing educational program, or alternatively, integrate the material from your program into Oppia.</li>
