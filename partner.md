<h1>Let's Make a Difference Together</h1>
<h2>We can make a difference in the lives of learners around the world.</h2>
<p>Improving education for all is a large effort, and your help could impact millions of learners. It doesn't matter where you come from, what language you speak, or how old or young you are â€” this is a community project! As long as you're willing to help, we'd love to have you join the cause.</p>

      <p>Oppia aspires to help millions of learners, but our impact is limited by our resources. Additional funds will help us to help more learners develop the skills they need to succeed. Your generous donation will go directly towards improving content (e.g. hiring teachers to create, review, and improve lessons) or improving the student experience (e.g. keeping the Oppia.org website up and running).</p>
      <p>Oppia has a scalable process for extending its reach and impacting more learners. Every dollar empowers us to scale that much more quickly.</p>

      <p>Create new lessons: Create new lessons on Oppia so students can learn a wider range of topics. You can create a lesson about anything you think is interesting! <a href="https://www.oppia.org/get_started">Click here to get started.</a></p>
      <p>Test existing lessons: Before publicizing a lesson, we want to make sure that it's effective and enjoyable. This means that students' skills improve by virtue of their playing it, and students play it to completion, even in the absence of any external pressure. <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Playtesting-explorations">Click here for instructions.</a></p>
      <p>Fix bugs and build new features: In addition to helping us improve Oppia's lessons, you can also contribute to our open source code base, product design process, and more. Your work will be used by potentially millions of learners. <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki">Click here to see how.</a></p>
